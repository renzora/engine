//! Environment map (IBL) component.
//!
//! Image-based lighting drives PBR reflections + ambient diffuse from a
//! cubemap. Right now we use Bevy's atmosphere-derived cubemap
//! (`AtmosphereEnvironmentMapLight`) — the procedural sky gets baked into
//! a cubemap each frame and fed back into the PBR pipeline.
//!
//! Architecturally separate from the atmosphere component because the
//! choice of "should reflections happen" is independent of "should the
//! sky render with scattering." A future HDR-cubemap variant can extend
//! the same component (see `EnvironmentMapKind` placeholder for where
//! that would live).
//!
//! ## Bevy 0.18 caveat
//!
//! Bevy locks the camera's bind group layout the first frame it renders,
//! with IBL slots present iff `AtmosphereEnvironmentMapLight` existed at
//! that moment. Adding/removing it later crashes wgpu. The camera spawn
//! site (in `renzora_engine`) attaches the component at low intensity so
//! the layout is stable; this plugin updates `intensity` in-place via
//! `EffectRouting`. `enabled = false` collapses intensity to 0 — visually
//! "off" without touching the bindings.
