# Renzora Engine `r1-alpha8`

## Unreleased
- fix(ci): the Windows build no longer fails its own MSVC runtime audit when there is nothing to report
- feat(ci): a manual build can target a single arch, such as `windows-x64`, instead of a whole operating system
- fix(windows): the engine, its plugins and exported games link the Visual C++ runtime in, so they start on a machine that has never installed the redistributable
- fix(macos): the editor no longer opens as "damaged" — the `.app` ships signed again
- feat(ci): macOS releases can be Developer ID signed and notarized when the signing secrets are set
